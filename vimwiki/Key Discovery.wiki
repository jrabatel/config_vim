== Basic definitions ==
S --> data source
C --> class

*Non keys* : 
A set of property expressions is a non-key for the class C in S if: 
There exist X, Y in C such that Y and X are different but share the same values on the property expressions

*Keys* :
For all X and Y in C, there exists at least one property expression such that the values of X and Y differ

*Undetermined Keys* :
A set of property expressions is an undetermined key if
 - it is not a non-key
 - for all property expression X and Y have the same value
 - there exists one property expression such that there does not exist any value for X and Y

Top-Down algorithm: the keys discovered for a given class are derived from its subclasses (i.e., more specific classes).

== Prefix Tree ==
 - each level corresponds to one property expression (i.e., one property)
 - each cell at a given level contains:
   - a value for the corresponding level
   - an (boolean) attribute to specifiy whether the value is null or not
   - a list of URI to the corresponding class instances
 - a prefix-path represents the set of instances that share the same values for the properties involvedin the path
