== Basic definitions ==
S --> data source
C --> class

*Non keys* : 
A set of property expressions is a non-key for the class C in S if: 
There exist X, Y in C such that Y and X are different but share the same values on the property expressions

*Keys* :
For all X and Y in C, there exists at least one property expression such that the values of X and Y differ

*Undetermined Keys* :
A set of property expressions is an undetermined key if
 - it is not a non-key
 - for all property expression X and Y have the same value
 - there exists one property expression such that there does not exist any value for X and Y

Top-Down algorithm: the keys discovered for a given class are derived from its subclasses (i.e., more specific classes).

== Prefix Tree ==
 - each level corresponds to one property expression (i.e., one property)
 - each cell at a given level contains:
   - a value for the corresponding level
   - an (boolean) attribute to specifiy whether the value is null or not
   - a list of URI to the corresponding class instances
 - a prefix-path represents the set of instances that share the same values for the properties involvedin the path

=== Intermediate Prefix Tree ===
 - to integrate the non-existence of some property values (i.e., null values), an intermediate prefix tree is built
 - the principle is simply to build null values and integrate them to the prefix tree
 - then, the final prefix tree is generated by replacing those newly create null values by the set of all possible values (i.e., the ones observed in the data)

== UNK-Finder Algorithm ==
Given the root of the prefix tree for a class, the number of attributes, and the already known keys (for subclasses)

3 types of pruning:
 - subsumption relation (by considering a set of inherited keys)
 - anti-monotonicity of non and undetermined keys
 - the monotonic property of keys

== Global remarks ==
 - Is it the complete set of keys which is retrieved? Indeed, the construction of the prefix-tree seems to impose which are the keys that will be checked... --> I do not understand something...
