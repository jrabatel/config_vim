== Pattern matcher ==
* [o] Optimizations based on multi-instance:
  * [ ] if preprocessing did not work because the domain of at least one vertex was empty, then do not test for other conformations of the same ligands. Note: this should work for vertex labels that are invariant wrt to the conformation (e.g., atom typing but not groundedAt).
  * [X] when the subgraph isomorphism test is false in a conformation, then we can order the vertices that "blocked" the test and test them first in the next conformations

== Input / Output ==
* [ ] Write input GraphViz method
* [ ] write down a file that can be read by Ronan

== Discretization ==
* [ ] Propose an equal-width discretization for distances
  * [ ] implementation of the discretizer
  * [ ] testing the different values
* [ ] Propose a variable discretization for coordinates

== Experiments ==
* [ ] Datasets: find and study some datasets with 3D information
* [o] Cross-Validation:
  * [ ] check whether the segmentation proposed is good or not
    * [ ] variance in all obtained folds --> statistical test?
  * [X] write the obtained segmentation and use it for all the experiments
* [ ] Automatically create some plots to summarize the results
* [ ] Add a parameter about the post-pruning of the DT

== Problems ==
* [ ] In the DT, the variance computation does not seem to be correct: leaves of size 1 have a non-0 variance value (positive or negative)
* [ ] Check the correctness of the DT tester: in a 1-fold cross-validation, test whether each conformation is associated to the correct leaf
