Skype meeting: Jan, Bertrand, Bruno, Julien

report
  - Pattern-based atom typing
    - full version of the pattern-based atom typing refiner (allowing further refinements of already labeled vertices)
  - Virtual Screening
    - no results yet when using the experimental framework defined by Muggleton et al.
    - Ronan should soon provide a multi-conformational version of the DUD datasets

to do
  - Pattern-based atom typing
    - are the DT obtained with new refinement operator unbalanced?
      - check it in the results
      - if it is the case, then impose a constraint on the maximum cardinality of the increment of itemsets to use in labels
  - Virtual Screening
    - run tests on the one-conformation version of the DUD datasets and compute values of quality measures (enrichment factor, AUROC, BEDROC)
    - study more precisely Muggleton's work
  - Various
    - updating the jak2 code so it will work with last mips repository version (deadline: end of November)
    - proposing a stable pattern language definition for Jan's master student (deadline: end of November)

Next meeting: 20/11/2012, 10.15am
