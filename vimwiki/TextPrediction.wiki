== Java implementation ==
TODO
* [ ] build a tree structure out of the pattern file
  * [ ] compute the confidence for each induced rule
  * [ ] input/output methods for the prefix-tree
  * [ ] given one sequence of text:
    * [ ] build the corresponding extended itemset
    * [ ] using the tree structure find the matching patterns and sort them by confidence
    * [ ] keep track at where we are in the tree to be able to quickly find matching patterns at the next step in the sequence

== Pattern mining ==
* [ ] Mining association rules in inter-transactional itemsets
  * [ ] converting text data into itemsets
    * [ ] C++ implementation
    * [ ] several functions to add some text:
      * [ ] addText
      * [ ] restart
    * [ ] if the total size of the file that stores the text is too big (regarding a given parameter), the beginning of the file is removed
    * [ ] allow different databases (for different contexts)
  * [ ] mining closed frequent itemsets
  * [ ] generate the association rules
  * [ ] removing association rules that are not temporally sequential (i.e., such that the rule conclusion is not situated after the left part of the rule)
* [ ] Contextual pattern mining in a set of texts
  * [ ] tranform the texts into the correct format 
  * [ ] create and associate the corresponding contextual values
  * [ ] call a miner (mining closed itemsets)

* [ ] storing the rules/patterns in files
* [ ] storing the rules/patterns in a data structure

== Prediction ==
* [ ] given the set of patterns and a sequence, what are the possible predictions?
* [ ] How to predict one word?
* [ ] How to predict a set of words?
* [ ] How to predict the current word according to the previous words, and the previous letters in the word?
* [ ] Given a set (i.e., not a sequence) of words, give some blocks of sentences that use these words

== Incremental learning ==
* [ ] how to change the weight of patterns according to their use, non-use?

== Text-prediction usage ==
* [ ] How to integrate it in vim?
* [ ] Exploitation in different contexts:
  * [ ] Mails
    * [ ] contexts can be given by the person(s) the mail is sent to, the language, etc.
  * [ ] Paper writing (latex)
    * [ ] In this case, the learning could be performed on a set of papers or books of a particular domain.
