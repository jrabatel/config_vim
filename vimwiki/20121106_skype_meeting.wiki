Skype meeting: Jan, Bertrand, Bruno, Julien

report
  - Pattern-based atom typing
    - collected and summarized experimental results on 4 Mohr's datasets
      - using pattern-based atom typing leads to an average reduction of the RMSE of 9.5%
      - this atom typing scheme will be used by default for the next experiments
    - Allowing further refinements for pattern-based atom typing?
  - Virtual Screening
    - Literature work: how to evaluate VS approaches in our context?
      - model learning, need for positive/negative examples, no natural similarity measure with query ligands
    - Found a new and recent experimental framework defined by Muggleton et al., 2012
    - Current work
      - Preparing the dataset for this experimental framework
        - very large test dataset: 95171
        - small learning datasets: 52 at max (32 positive + 20 negative examples)

to do
  - Pattern-based atom typing
    - implement a new version of the atom typing allowing further refinements of already labeled vertices
      - requires building a pattern lattice and the corresponding operators
  - Virtual Screening
    - adopt and test the experimental framework defined by Muggleton et al. (Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 2012)

Next meeting: 13/11/2012, 10.15am
