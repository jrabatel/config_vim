Goal: mining closed graph patterns
Relies on 2 ideas: the equivalent occurrences and the early termination

Equivalent occurrence:
Occurrence of g (pattern graph) in D (graph database): the sum of the nb of occurrences in every g' in D

Extendable subgraph isomorphism of g to g' in a graph G: given g' is an extension of g by adding an edge, this is a subgraph isomorphism of g in G such that it can be extended to obtain a subgraph isomorphism of g' in G.

Extended occurrence of g' in D w.r.t. g: the sum of the number of extendable subg. isomorphisms in the whole database.

Equivalen occurrence: g and g' have the equivalent occurrence iff the occurrence of g equals the extended occurrence of g' w.r.t. g.
