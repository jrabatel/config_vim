Spline-fitting with a genetic algorithm: A method for developing classification structure-activity relationships

p1906:


Scaffold Hopping in Drug discovery..., Muggleton 2008

scaffold hopping --> find structurally diverse compounds that share common properties

Data preparation:
10 datasets from PubChem database
1st build from HTS results
Build sets of active and inactive compounds from each HTS result
OpenBabel to convert structure data files to fingerprints (based on the occurrence of linear fragment up to seven atoms in length)
Active and inactive compounds in each HTS result were respectively clustered by their chemical similartities based on modified Tanimoto coefficient

Background knowledge:
positively/negatively charged
HBD/HBA
lipophilicity

ILP:
Rule space:
reduced to
- relationships between 2 atoms
- concatenated pairs of relationships
- triangle relationships
- no relationships among only lipophilic atoms

Comparison of methods:
CATS
CATS3D
