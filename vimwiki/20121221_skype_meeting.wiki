report
  - a large part of accuracy results from Muggleton is due to molecular descriptors
  - current integrating a list of easily available molecular descriptors (through OpenBabel)

  - pattern language discussion
    - our current pattern language
      - atom with rich atom typing information through itemset-based labeling
      - distances based on intervals through discretization
      - arbitrary complex structure (general class of graphs)
      - no molecular descriptors
    - ILP-based pattern language (Muggleton)
      - predefined list of fragments (integrating background knowledge)
      - intervals for distances (1 angstrom of tolerance) between fragments
      - molecular descriptors
      - patterns contain 1 or 2 fragments only

  - how to reach something exploitable?
    - extending the pattern language (e.g., by using -predefined or mined- fragments)
    - work on the possibilities offered by the target binding-site integration (need to define the problem)
    - modifying the virtual screening framework by adding dynamicity in the learning/testing process

todo
  - experiments with molecular descriptors
  - run tests on jak2 data, with new possibilities:
    - itemset-based vertex labeling
    - itemset-based protein vertex labeling
  - run tests on mutagenesis data

Next skype meeting: to decide by email
