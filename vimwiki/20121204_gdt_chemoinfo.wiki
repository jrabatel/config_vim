INTRODUCTION
- Drug design
- Problem of lead compound discovery
  - size of chemical space

VIRTUAL SCREENING
- Virtual Screening
  - families of virtual screening approaches
  - Ligand-based vs Structure-based VS
- Need for expressivity (to describe a complex phenomenon)
- Need for interpretability: opens a real opportunity for collaboration work (experts can understand results, modify rules, make suggestions, etc.)

GEOMETRICAL PATTERNS
- Goal
  - describe biological activity phenomenon by considering both chemical and 3D information (both of importance when considering)
- pattern language
- extraction
  - the atom typing problem: how to allow a rich expressivity and computationally reasonable solution?
- decision trees
  - expressivity, able to handle continuous target value, interpretability and explanations
  - Warning: should detail the problems of generating/selecting tests
  - random forest

GEOMETRICAL PATTERNS AND VIRTUAL SCREENING
- Experimental framework
- DUD datasets
- quality measures

PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
- benchmark data: DUD
- quality measures: based on ranking more than prediction
- to use: "4D" representation of the data

CONCLUSION
- first experimental results to improve
  - how to balance interpretability / accuracy?
- applicability to other problems as well
  - activity prediction
  - toxicity prediction / description
- a very flexible pattern language
  - can merge multi-source information (protein side, chemical background knowledge, 3D/4D information, multi-targets, multi-ligands, etc.
