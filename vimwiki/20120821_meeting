* What has been done?

  * With Ronan
    * results can greatly depend on the docking software tool used to generate the conformations
    * new datasets for jak2
      * corresponding to other docking tools (CDocker, GOLD, libdock)
      * Results: 
        * problems with one of the datasets (to be addressed with Ronan after he comes back)
        * results seem more interesting but it may have conformation generation problems
        * in terms of prediction, the variation is not that large

  * Protein-Ligand interaction and how to describe it through new tests
    * We tested Anchor atom ID before holidays (a ligand atom and a protein atom are closed enough)
    * After the discussion with Ronan, it seems that it is more relevant to consider directly the possible types of interactions between ligand and protein.
      * lip-lip interaction
      * HBD/HBA interaction
    * Results:
      * the new tests are used a lot in the DT, but the quantitative results are not significantly better

  * Conformation score provided by the docking software
    * since the results could greatly depend on conformations (and the tool to generate them) we came up with the idea of taking into account the conformation score provided by the docking software)
    * new test corresponding to some docking score threshold
    * Results:
      * the new tests are used a lot in the DT, but the quantitative results are not significantly better

* To be done
  * test the approach with a dataset (mutagenicity) that is well-known and has been used a lot in the literature (without 3D information)
  * work on the correcteness of the algorithm
  * implement bondedTo in order to be able to take into account the topology of molecules and compare with classical approaches
  * integrate the decoys provided by Ronan for the jak2 data
    * how to use them?
    * how are they generated?
    * how to address a docking scoring problem?
