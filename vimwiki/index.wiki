  * [X] preprocess 5 datasets
  * [X] run tests on explorer
    * [X] 1-step refiner
    * [X] 2-step refiner
* [X] Work on memory consumption issues
  * [X] Remarks:
   - replaced the testCollection by the DBWrapper
   - patterns and corresponding tests are generated, but they are not selected ? --> resulting DT only contain the root
   - when counting the nb of patterns generated and destructed, there is a gap : not all patterns are destructed, where they should be destructed just before creating a new one
* [X] change audition presentation

* [X] Paper
  * [X] read paper
    - QSAR based on the similarity between 3D structures (molecule kernel, independent of the spatial prealignement of the compounds)
    - Kernel + potential SVM
    - Relying on pairs of ordered bipods (V-shaped subfragments)
    - Related work compared with the approach:
      - Hologram QSAR (HQSAR) --> divides each molecule into a set of overlapping structural fragments and uses their frequency as 2D descriptors
      - Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFa) --> 3D QSAR, based on the idea similar steric and electrostatic fields of molecules lead to similar activity. Requires the spatial-imposition of the molecular structures, which needs expert knowledge and is time-consuming and might introduce user-bias
      - CoMSIA (comparative molecular similarity index analysis) --> altervative method to CoMFa
      - GRIND method: 3D QSAR --> only applicable for a set of compounds sharing a common scaffold
      - EVA (eigenvalue analysis)
    - molecular alignment = rigid transformation of the coordinates of a molecule
    - DATASETS
      - Fontaine (classification): 435 molecules (156 low-, 279 high-activity)
      - ACE (regression): 114 molecules
      - AChE (regression): 111 molecules
      - BZR (regression): 163 molecules
      - DHFR (regression) 397 examples

* [o] JAK2
  * [O] compare with the results of the genetic algo paper
    * [X] in reading the input data, change IC50 to 1 or 0 whether it is above/below the given threshold --> 0 is inactive, 1 is active
    * [X] remove log(IC50)
    * [ ] note results in classification

    * [X] found and fixed

Tue May 22 09:22:11 CEST 2012
* [X] JAK2
  * [X] test with/without keeping alternative patterns
    * [X] Result: no difference at all between keeping and not keeping intermediate patterns
  * [X] explicitely clear the test collection of a node when it has been finished (in mips)
    * [X] clear the container (DBWrapper == TestCollection) when all tests have been checked
    * [X] print memory usage before and after --> no effect at all on the destruction of the patterns
    * [X] find a way to clear the patterns when the test collection is cleared
      * [X] Problem: in a test, the pattern is associated with a boost::shared_ptr --> maybe even when the test collection is cleared, the patterns are pointed by more than one object (i.e., by at least another object than the test itself) --> yes, there are several references to the same pattern (2 at the beginning, 3 after).
      * [X] Is there a case where there is only 1 reference to a pattern? --> apparently not. So, why patterns are sometimes destructed?
      * [X] in removeUsedTestGenerator.hpp it seems that the test collection of a parent node is copied and passed to children? --> not used for jak2
      * [X] print the number of references to a pattern
      * [X] in embeddingTest (jak2), create a delete function
      * [X] is the number of references to a pattern the same for 1 and 2-step refiners?

mercredi 7 mars 2012, 17:21:53 (UTC+0100)
* [X] Presentation preparation for IATE on 2012-03-09
  * [X] S6: better link between association rules and FCA?
  * [X] S6: "the attributes are directly viewed as itemsets" --> "the attributes are directly viewed as items"
  * [X] S7: not "translating the FCA problem into a frequent itemset mining problem"?
  * [X] S7: automatic ontology elicitation?
  * [X] S30: put an image from the last presentation?
  * [X] S32: first line : ????! :)
  * [X] At the beginning, make a slide on the itemset mining problem (quite simple) in order to better see the translation into FCA
    * [X] Quick presentation of the problem --> example(s)
    * [X] Show the link with knowledge acquisition
  * [X] Implications in a concept lattice
    * [X] have a good understanding of it: e.g., what happens with dog?
    * [X] introduce the fact that association rules can also provide this type of rules, but with a less "crisp" notion of implication
  * [X] How to introduce sequential pattern mining?
  * [X] How to introduce contextual pattern mining?
    * [X] think about the exploitation of contextual pattern mining in itemsets : what can it give that classical pattern mining can't? Domain knowledge can be exploited in order to build the context hiearchy
  * [X] When showing items in sequences that are related to originally numerical attributes, speak about fuzzy logic and pattern mining techniques?
  * [X] Show one context hierarchy in the slides?
  * [X] Globally highlight the fact that extracting patterns is usually very good when dealing with experts : they are interpretable (like the original idea of fuzzy logic?.. :) )
  * [X] Find a concrete example of the fact that contextual information can be seen at a different level than attributes-values
  * [X] when dealing with sequential patterns, mention that it is about dealing with structured data (sequences, graphs, etc.), which is a more complex domain than itemsets, but that can model numerous real-world domains (e.g., time-related domains, bioinformatics, texts, chemistry, etc.). Mention the fact that I already have worked on numbers of them.
  * [X] Two directions: from pattern mining to knowledge and "from knowledge (ontologies, taxonomies) to patterns to applications"
    * [X] Direction 1
      * [X] fastly provide an ontology based on concepts taht can be observed within the data (then validation)
    * [X] Direction 2
      * [X] being able to extract patterns at a given level of a taxonomy or directly exploiting the different levels of a taxonomy (without a specified one)
      * [X] use the obtained knowledge to build the contexts that will be used in order to obtain precise results
